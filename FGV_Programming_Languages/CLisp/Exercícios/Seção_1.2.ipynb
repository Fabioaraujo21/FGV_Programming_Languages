    "There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables a and b in the fib-iter process of Section 1.2.2: $a \\leftarrow a+b$ and $b \\leftarrow a$. Call this transformation T, and observe that applying T overandoveragainn times,startingwith1and0,produces the pair Fib(n +1) and Fib(n). In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying $T^{n}$, the $n^{th}$ power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1,0). Now consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations $ T_{pq} $, where $ T_{pq} $ transforms the pair (a,b) according to $a \\leftarrow bq+aq+ap$ and $b \\leftarrow bp+aq$. Show that if we apply such a transformation $ T_{pq} $ twice, the eﬀect is the same as using a single transformation $ T_{p'q'} $  of the same form, and compute p′and q′ in terms of p and q.  This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute $T^{n}$ using successive squaring, as in the fast-expt procedure.

    "##### Exercise 1.28:\n",
    "One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the $\\textit{Miller-Rabin test}$  (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that if $n$ is a prime number and $a$ is any positive integer less than n, then $a$ raised to the $(n−1)-st$ power is congruent to 1 modulo $n$. To test the primality of a number $n$ by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number $a < n$ and raise $a$ to the $(n−1)-st$ power modulo $n$ using the expmod procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in expmod, we check to see if we have discovered a “non trivial square root of 1 modulo $n$,” that is, a number not equal to 1 or $n−1$ whose square is equalto 1 modulo $n$. It is possible to prove that if such a non trivial square root of 1 exists, then $n$ is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if $n$ is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers $a < n$, computing $a^{n−1}$ in this way will reveal a non trivial square root of 1 modulon. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the expmod procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. \n",
